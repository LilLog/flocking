Touchdesigner projects that implement the flocking boids behavior.
## Steering
A triangular object steered by the location of mouse cursor.
## Wandering
![Wandering](/wandering0.PNG)

Two objects wandering with a random steering force, bounded by a continuous boundary condition, allowing the objects to reappear on the opposite side of the boundary. Their paths are tracked by two small circular objects, leaving discontinuous dot traces.
## Flocking 2D

100 flocking boids bounded within a rectangle area. The boids would turn back when they are close to the boundary.
